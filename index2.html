            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Call me Talha. I go by “talha131” at Github, DEV, and GoodReads. Email is the best way to reach me. <br>

                I work on Jump Desktop. It is a remote desktop application for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows. I play
                a broad role there; which includes research, product design, engineering, and deployment. I also lend a
                hand in user support. <br>

                I have been working in the field for more than a decade. I do not pigeonhole myself to specific
                languages or frameworks. <br>

                Through the years, I have learned and worked in several programming languages and frameworks. I have
                built apps for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. I am comfortable working in C, C++, Objective-C,
                C#, Python, and Java. <br>

                I took up web development since early 2016 and picked up Go and NodeJS. I have built and delivered apps
                using ReactJS, Mobx, Redux, and ElectronJS. <br>

                Besides the day job, I contribute to open source projects, beta test startup products, and offer
                consultancy. I work on my physical fitness and read books regularly; to be a stronger and better version
                of myself! <br>
            </p>

            <h1>What is the intent behind this website?</h1>

            <p>
                Years ago I was naive and lacked career counseling. I aspire, these notes and observations, to help
                green Software developers who are in the same boat as I was.
